# Discord Exchange

A Discord bot which attempts to imitate a multi-currency economy.

## Disclaimer

*Should I put this part in big red text?*

Discord Exchange is **NOT** designed for handling trades involving real-world money

I can not be held responsible for the decisions of users.

> Trading items with real-world value for Discord Exchange Tokens is not permitted.

## What is it?

Discord Exchange is a project which allows users to Earn, Trade and Share different simulated currencies or "tokens".

Different servers can create their own tokens to join in on the ecosystem, allowing their members to create their own wallet, and begin earning.

Servers can then set up "shops" to allow users to purchase roles, etc. using their tokens.

## Why?

This entire project basically started because of a random idea I had one day.

There is no certainty that it will be actively maintained and worked on into the future, which is part of why I'm making this open-source in the first place.

## How does it work?

Well, that much hasn't quite been figured out yet, But I'm open to ideas and suggestions!
